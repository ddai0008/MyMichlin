# MyMichlin

MyMichlin is an iOS app developed as part of a university project （FIT3175). It showcases my skills in Swift and Xcode, focusing on restaurant discovery and exploration. The project was built using **Storyboard** and follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture**. Key technologies include **MapKit**, **CoreData**, and various **SDK APIs**. Ultimately achieved a High Distinction. 

**Note:** This project will no longer work due to the expiry of the API key. However, the code is provided for reference. For more details about this project, please contact me.
