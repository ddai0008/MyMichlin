# MyMichlin – iOS Restaurant Discovery App

MyMichlin is an iOS app developed as part of the FIT3175 Mobile Application Development unit.
It is a restaurant discovery application inspired by Michelin-style listings, showcasing my ability to design and build a complete iOS application using Swift, Storyboard, MVC architecture, and multiple iOS frameworks.

This project achieved a High Distinction (95%), meeting all requirements for UI design, functionality, code quality, and technical implementation.

**Note:** This app relies on external APIs (Gemini, Google Places, Google Maps). These API keys have expired and have been removed for security. The project will not run without valid keys. The repo is for reference purposes. For details or a walkthrough, feel free to contact me.
**Disclaimer** Google Place API does not permit local caching of restaurant information. This app temporarily caches restaurants' information to showcase knowledge for academic purposes.
